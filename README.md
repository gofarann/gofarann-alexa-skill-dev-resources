# helpful-alexa-skill-resources
A list of resources I found helpful to create an alexa skill from start to finish with the Alexa Skills Kit Node.js SDK.

## Tutorials & Sample Code
I looked over quite a few tutorials and found these three to be the most helpful to get started. I would do them in this order. 
* [Step-By-Step Environment Setup](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-howto)
* [Hello World](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-hello-world)
* [City Guide Tutorial](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-city-guide/blob/master/README.md)

## Trouble-Shooting
* [CloudWatch Error Logs](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home) - make sure it's in the same region as where Lambda code is hosted, which is probably US East (N. Virginia)
* [Stack Overflow Alexa Skills Kit Tag] (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/alexa-skills-kit) - good for beginner problems. 
* [Amazon Developer Forums](https://forums.developer.amazon.com/spaces/23/Alexa+Skills+Kit.html) - good for advanced problems and finding out if there are systematic issues happening across the Alexa platform. 


## Tips & Things I wish I Would've Known
* Make sure
